    <h1>The Graduate</h1>
    

    <p>The Graduate is a classic movie about a recent college graduate that doesn't know what to do after college. The main character is seduced into having an affair with a friend of his parents. After the affair, he falls in love with the daughter of his parents' friend.<br> <br>
    The Graduate is my favorite movie because it was made when acting was relatively new, so I can't help but laugh at some of the scenes. The plot is simple and effective. Also, the soundtrack for the movie is done by Simon and Garfunkel.</p>

    <p>Characters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ben Braddock</li>
        <li>Elaine Robinson</li>
        <li>Mr. and Mrs. Robinson</li>
        <li>Mr. and Mrs. Braddock</li>
        <li>Carl Smith</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Quote from Movie:</h3>
    <p>
        Mrs. Braddock: What makes you think she wants to marry you?<br>
        Benjamin: Oh, she doesn't. To be perfectly honest, she doesn't like me.
