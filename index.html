        I am interested in web development so that I can make some helpful websites for myself and others. I think it would be interesting to make websites pertaining to my hobbies, and to make websites to help people who are starting businesses. I know of several people who would like to start a business, and being able to make a website for them would help their business tremendously. Making websites where users could make orders or create appointments would be interesting to learn and quite useful. When it comes to my hobbies, there are a few videogames and card games where being able to track certain stats online would be useful. Ultimately I think being able to make websites is a very important thing I can include in my resume given the prevalence of them. I would like to have a portfolio website that shows my proficiency in making websites.
